### 1.2 About RFM
The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value.
- Recency: measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: measures how often a customer has made purchases.
- Monetary Value: measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.
RFM is used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and how recently and frequently they have made purchases, as well as the monetary value of those purchases.
In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores
